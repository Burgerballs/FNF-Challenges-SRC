# FNF-Challenges

FNF-Challenges (not to be confused with the database named FNF-Challenges on my account), is an online-based FNF mod which makes use of Psych Engine LUA and a whole bunch of HTTP in order to make a neat little challenge mode!

# COMPILATION

Everything is compiled in the same way as the original Psych Engine, I intend to also add some binaries to releases in the future.
